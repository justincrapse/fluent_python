Functions in Python are first-class objects. Programming language theorists define a “first-class object” as a program
entity that can be:
Created at runtime
Assigned to a variable or element in a data structure
Passed as an argument to a function
Returned as the result of a function

Higher-Order Functions:
A function that takes a function as argument or returns a function as the result is a higher-order function.

user-defined functions have many attributes including a dict, name, and globals. Do a set diff between your function
"func" and the obj object to see: sorted( set( dir( func)) - set( dir( obj)))
