Operator overloading - Python does not let you overload the built-in types operator special methods. This would cause
a lot of confusion with unexpected behavior. Also, overloading is limited to existing operators, except for a few (is,
and, or, not. [though &, |, ! can be].)

NotImplemented special value - this will allow the interpreter to try again by swapping the operands and calling the
reverse special method for that operator (e.g., __radd__)
