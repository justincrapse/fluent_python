If you want to extend the Python built-ins with custom classes, Do not do this with the actual built-ins. This will
cause huge problems with the method resolution order because the built-ins have C implementations that do not
handle python user-defined classes method resolution order as expected. Instead, you must extend from the collections
module and use UserList, UserString, and UserDict etc.

MRO for multiple inheritance:
class A:
class B(A):
class C(A):
class D(B, C)
method resolution: (D, B, C, A)

Favor composition over inheritance.
