Decorated methods will run the decorator(decorated_func) at import time before anything is called because the decorated
syntax is syntactic sugar for an explicit call.

import time is the code running the the module at import or __name__ == '__main__'. Runtime is when the code is actually
executed/called.

Closures - A function with an extended scope that encompasses nonglobal variables referenced in teh body of the function
but not defined there.
