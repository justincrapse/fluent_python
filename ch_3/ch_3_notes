Keys must be hashable objects An object is hashable if all of these requirements are met: It supports the hash() 
function via a __hash__() method that always returns the same value over the lifetime of the object. It supports 
equality via an __eq__() method. If a = = b is True then hash( a) = = hash( b) must also be True. User-defined types
are hashable by default because their hash value is their id() and they all compare not equal.
